# Introduction

## Meet Jest Preview

We are sure you are tired of debugging integration UI tests and reading a whole lot of cryptic HTML output. It's incredibly tough to visualize the DOM structure and see what went wrong and why. We are sure because we were there. That's why we have created Jest Preview!

Jest Preview is an open-source library to make your life easier. See your test output directly in the browser as you would normally see the app you are working on. Write test and watch rendered output changes accordingly. Jest Preview lets you concentrate on tests in the "real world" rather than deciphering HTML code. Sounds interesting? Sure it does! Give it a try 😉
