`jest-preview` is initially designed to work with [jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/). The package is framework-agnostic, and you can use it with any testing libraries.

## How to use `jest-preview` in 2 lines of code

Start the Jest Preview Server by running the CLI command `jest-preview`. 

```diff
+import preview from 'jest-preview';

describe('App', () => {
  it('should work as expected', () => {
    render(<App />);
+    preview.debug();
  });
});
```

Or:

```diff
+import { debug } from 'jest-preview';

describe('App', () => {
  it('should work as expected', () => {
    render(<App />);

  });
});
```

**It's that simple!**
